# V Rising Mouselook AutoHotkey Script

* When mouselook is toggled, the cursor will snap top center such that the action wheel is easily accessible.
* Mouselook is automatically disabled when using the action wheel and gets immediatedly reenabled after if it were active.
* *WARNING:* Mouselook orientation breaks when accessing containers, as that uses the same key as item pickup and thus shouldn't be mapped to exit mouselook.


## Controls

The ones the AutoHotkey uses **have** to be remapped as below; others are just my personal preference:

| Skill/Attack | Key | Comment |
|--------------|-----|---------|
| Weapon Skill 1 | RMB | |
| Weapon SKill 2 | MMB | |
| Spell Slot 1 | Q | |
| Spell Slot 2 | E | |
| Jump from Cliffs | C | Yeah, this was the perfect use of the Shift key... |
| Action Wheel | / | AutoHotkey CTRL |
